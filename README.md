# GET READY TO DANCE BOI

A project in React to make a dance floor that moves. Inspired by I don't know what, but it's been really fun to build.

Future features list:
- ability to add new dance floor patterns that persist locally and are playable
- ability to manage local floor patterns (delete unwanted)
- ~~ability to toggle pulse control (unlit tiles are lit, lit tiles are unlit)~~
- ~~ability to toggle color inversion (set color classes to complementary values)~~
- ~~more default patterns~~
