# GET READY TO DANCE BOI

A project in React to make a dance floor that moves. Inspired by I don't know what, but it's been really fun to build.

Future features list:
- ability to add new dance floor patterns that persist locally
- ability to set variable frame lengths per frame of an added pattern
- ability to toggle pulse control (unlit tiles are lit, lit tiles are unlit)
- ability to set pulse speed
- ability to toggle color inversion (set color classes to complementary values)
- more default patterns
